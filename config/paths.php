* The define() function defines a constant.

*Constants are much like variables, except for the following differences:
*
*A constant's value cannot be changed after it is set
*Constant names do not need a leading dollar sign ($)
*Constants can be accessed regardless of scope
*Constant values can only be strings and numbers
